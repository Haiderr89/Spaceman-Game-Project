## Description: 
The ***Spaceman Game (among us edition)*** is a fun twist on the classic Hangman game, built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. Players guess a hidden word with hints, selecting letters from an on-screen keyboard. Incorrect guesses update the "spaceman" image, with the game ending after six wrong guesses or a win when the word is guessed. I chose this project for its blend of challenge and simplicity, offering a nostalgic yet engaging way to demonstrate web development skills.

***How to play:***
* **Goal:** Guess the word before the Among Us character explodes.
* **Tries:6** wrong guesses = explosion.
* **Hint:** Each word comes with a hint.
* **Gameplay:** Guess letters; correct ones fill blanks, wrong ones lose tries.
* **Winning:** Save the character by guessing the word or lose if it explodes.
